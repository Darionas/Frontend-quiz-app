## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (mobile-first workflow)
    - Flexbox
    - CSS Grid
- JavaScript (fetch JSON)

But created with :heart:

### What I learned

to work with design files
- use custom properties and utility classes
- To style a toggle button when it receives focus via the Tab key (keyboard navigation).
- create light-dark mode in css and javaScript. Load mode kept in localStorage, even after page refresh or if you open that page in a while.

### Continued development

- Continue learning Figma to work with design files

### Useful resources

- [Light-Dark toggle with CSS & JS (with Kevin Powell)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wodWDIdV9BY) - A look at how to create a dark mode toggle switch using CSS & JS, which saves the person's preference in localStorage for the next time they visit.
